# Welcome

I’m a PhD candidate in Economics at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto.
My research focuses on Industrial Organization, with a special interest in topics related to market power.
In my job market paper, I examine the effects of market concentration in the publishing industry, with a focus on both monopsony and monopoly power.

I completed both my undergraduate and Master's studies in Economics at the Universidad de la República in Uruguay.
